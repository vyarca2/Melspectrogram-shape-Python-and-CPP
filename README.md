# Melspectrogram-shape-Python-and-CPP

This repository contains the files needed to generate a melspectrogram for an audio file in both Python and C++ and compare the shapes using Pytest in a Python Notebook environment. You can also run this notebook locally with suitable modifications to the header files and paths. The C++ program is to be run separately. Ensure all dependencies are installed before running Pytest.
